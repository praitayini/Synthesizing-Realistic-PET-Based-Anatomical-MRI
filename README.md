# Synthesizing-Realistic-PET-Based-Anatomical-MRI

More images are created to improve the accuracy of PET based Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD). If these CAD systems have more data to work with the better they will diagnose patients. These CAD systems have machine learning techniques build into them but they just need a larger sample size to learn. 

The main.py is implementation of U-net convolutional neural network. This network reads in MRI scan images from the training data set and learns how to transform them into PET scan images. The network then returns the data layers that should be applied to the MRI images to transform them into PET scan images. 

The validation code here reads the validation data set along with the model generated by the U-net and apply the transformation values onto the image. The return from the validation code would be our PET scan that was constructed from a MRI image.
